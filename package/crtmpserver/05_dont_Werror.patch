Subject: Don't set -Werror
Bug-Debian: http://bugs.debian.org/625316

This package builds with -Werror, and GCC 4.6 triggers new warnings
which will make the package fail to build.  Currently a Debian patch
just passes
    -Wno-error=unused-but-set-variable and
    -Wno-error=unused-but-set-parameter
to avoid build failures, but this patch will be reverted with the
GCC 4.6.1 release, and the severity of the report will be raised.
